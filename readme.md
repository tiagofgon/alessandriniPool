# Master thesis project
The main objective of this project was reserch the parallelism wich C++ can offer.
The result of the study was develop a multithreading based library inspired on Vath and Thread Pool libraries.

## Vath
A relatively small, high-level library used in the book **Shared Memory Application Programming Concepts and strategies in multicore application programming**, called vath, written by the book author **Victor Alessandrini**.
This library proposes some high-level, easy-to-use utilities in the form of C++ classes that encapsulate
the low-level primitives provided by the basic libraries.
The main propose use of this library on this project is to take advantage of the SPool and NPool thread pool classes proposed, implementing, respectively, a thread-centric or a task-centric programming environment.
