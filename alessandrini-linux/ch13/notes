Somme indications for the execution of the chapter 13 examples
--------------------------------------------------------------

This chapter proposes several different versions of a molecular
dynamic code. All codes are portable, and run on any "vath"
implementation (Pthreads, Windiws or C++11)

The general purpose code versions are:
-------------------------------------

-) Md.C (make md).        Sequential version
-) MdTh.C (make mdth).    Parallel version, using the SPool pool
-) MdTbb.C (make mdtbb).  Parallel version, using the TBB parallel_reduce
                          algorithm

-) MdOmp.C (make mdomp).   OpenMP macrotasking version.
-) MdOmpF.C (make mdompf). OpenMP, microtasking version


To compile all except OpenMP      :  make all
To run all except OpenMP          :  make runall

To compile all OpenMP examples    :  make allomp
To run all OpenMP                 :  make runomp

INTEL SUB-DIRECTORY: the /intel subdirectory contains the intel compiler
specific makefile, including vectorization options, as well as the sources
modified to incorporate vectorization and memory alignment directives.
Just go to this directory and proceed as ussual.
