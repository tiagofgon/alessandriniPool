Somme indications for the execution of the chapter 13 examples
using the Intel compiler and vectorization options
--------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the codes used to perform the performance
analysis reported in the book. Some sources are the same as in the
general purpose repository: md.C, MdTbb.C, mdomp.C, mdompF.C

Modified sources:

-) mdth.C: replaces the traditional barrier by a spin barrier when  
   SP_BARRIER is defined (as it is the case by default in the source)
   The idea is to look at the performance of the improved barrier algorithm,
   as discussed in the book

-) mdompv.C: adds vectorization directives to the mdomp.C code. In addition,
   this code is used to check the performance impact of memory alignment.
   If ALIGNED_MEM_ALLOC is defined botn in mdompv.C and mdaux.C, all
   memory allocations use the intel interfaces for 64 bit alignment.
