Somme indications for the execution of the chapter 13 examples
using the Intel compiler and vectorization options
--------------------------------------------------------------

This directory contains the codes used to perform the performance
analysis reported in the book. They are all OpenMP codes, using the
vactorization and memory alihnment features of the Intel compiler.
The makefile here is specific to the Intel compiler.

-) HeatOmp1.C: (make heat1). Basic parallel version, using OpenMP, no
               vectorization, no aligned memory allocation, no strip mining

-) HeatOmp2.C: (make heat2). Parallel OpenMP version, vectorized code, 
               no aligned memory allocation, no strip mining

-) HeatOmp3.C: (make heat3). Parallel OpenMP version, vectorized code, 
               aligned memory allocation, no strip mining

-) HeatOmp4.C: (make heat4). Parallel OpenMP version, vectorized code, 
               aligned memory allocation, strip mining
