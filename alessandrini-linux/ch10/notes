Somme indications for the execution of the examples in this
chapter.
-----------------------------------------------------------

There are only OpenMP codes in this chapter. They are often linked
to the vath library (mainly to benefit from the CpuTimer class), and
sometimes to the TBB library.

OPENMP_ENV must be set. Otherwise, codes will compile and execute, but
the OpenMP directives will be ignored.

There are two examples of the OpenMP4 "cancel" directive, to cancel
parallel region or task_groups: dbomp4_a and dbomp4_b. In running these
examples, is is necessary to set the environment variable:

export OMP_CANCELLATION=true

Otherwise, the cancel directive is ignored and the examples do not work.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

To compile all pre-omp4 codes:  make allomp
To run all pre-omp4 codes    :  make runomp

To compile all omp4 codes    :  make allomp4
To run ann omp4 codes        :  make runomp4

Remember:
--------
Unset the environment variables when they are no longer needed.

Setting and unsetting environment variables (Linux)
---------------------------------------------------

export OPENMP_ENV=1  (the value 1 is irrelevant) to set
export OPENMP_ENV=    to unset
