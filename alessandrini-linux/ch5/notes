Somme indications for the execution of the examples in this
chapter.

-----------------------------------------------------------

There are four types of examples in this directory:

- Pthreads codes
- Codes based on the C++11 thread library
- OpenMP examples
- One portable code using SPool threads + TBB


To compile the SPool-TBB code:  make scap_tbb
To run the SPool-TBB code    :  ./scap_tbb

To compile all Pthreads codes:  make allpth
To run all Pthreads codes    :  make runpth

To compile all C++11 codes   :  set CPP11_ENV; make allstd
To run ann C++11 codes       :  make runstd

To compile all OpenMP codes  :  set OPENMP_ENV; make allomp
To run all OpenMP codes      :  make runomp

Remember:
--------
Unset the environment variables when they are no longer needed.

Setting and unsetting environment variables (Linux)
---------------------------------------------------

export CPP11_ENV=1  (the value 1 is irrelevant) to set
export CPP11_ENV=    to unset
