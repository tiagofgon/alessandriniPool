Somme indications for the execution of the examples in this
chapter.

-----------------------------------------------------------

There are three types of examples:

- Codes based on the Pthreads library
- Codes based on the C++11 threads
- OpenMP codes


To compile all Pthreads codes:  make allpth
To run all Pthreads codes    :  make runpth 

To compile all C++11 codes   :  set CPP11_ENV ; make allstd
To run ann Boost codes       :  make runstd

To compile all OpenMP codes  :  set OPENMP_ENV; make allomp
To run ann SPool codes       :  make runomp

Remember:
--------
Unset the environment variables when they are no longer needed.


Setting and unsetting environment variables (Linux)
---------------------------------------------------

export CPP11_ENV=1  (the value 1 is irrelevant) to set
export CPP11_ENV=    to unset
